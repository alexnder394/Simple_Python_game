# Simple_Python_game
This is a simple rock paper sissors game in python implemnting the basics of conditionals and comparison operators.
I have also used the random module to make the game playable against computer.
The game has several checks to ensure that players enter their choice as lower case text by hand "rock", "paper", or "scissors" through the .lower() method
